        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Business Administration - Marketing</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> My education background includes attending high school at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California and currently attending the University of California, Riverside. I am currently a third year studying Business Administration, concentrating in Marketing. When I am finished with my undergraduate studies, I plan to take a gap year to focus on a job or internship. When that year is over, I plan to go back to school to study to achieve my MBS, but there is a possibility I could study to become a lawyer. When I was in the fifth grade, my mother had started law school as a personal task she wanted to achieve. She would read me cases and allow me to give my thoughts on where the case would go and what I believed would happen legally. Since then, I have had an interest in law and have thought that I will eventually study law like she had. <br><br>

        If I plan to pursue a career with marketing, I hope to focus on social media. I find marketing for companies on social media quite interesting and I hope to have a part in that area of marketing. If not, I find the whole topic of marketing quite interesting and believe that it will be a job that I enjoy. If I decide to take the route of law, I am still struggling with the specific type of law I would like to be a part of. I find criminal law quite interesting, but also feel that I would be good in family law. There is also the option of using my knowledge of business to pursue some sort of business law, but that is something I have time to think about and will be able to decide for my future at a later time. There are many opportunities that I am able to pursue for my future and cannot wait to see where I decide go in terms of my future career. <br><br>

        When I find the free time, I enjoy binge watching shows, spending time with my friends, family, and boyfriend, and going to Disneyland. From time to time, I enjoy spending time drawing or doing ant type of art, practicing to enhance my makeup skills, or baking for my friends and family. My favorite item to bake are these Captain Crunch cookies my sister found a recipe to, but I enjoy making cupcakes as well. Due to recent circumstances, I have had a chance to spend time to enjoy most of my hobbies. I have realized that I want to find more hobbies to learn and also go back to old hobbies I have put on hold, such as reading. Recently I have not been able to spend time to read, but I hope to rehash this hobby I used to love. Besides reading, I have always had a passion for photography and editing and I hope to continue that passion as well as acting on my passion of cinematography.
